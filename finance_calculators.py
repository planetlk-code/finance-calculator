'''
For this task, there are a lot of 'input' calls that are conditional on a response. i.e. only accept 'investment' or 'bond'.
So I wrote a function called 'ask_input' to make this easier.

This function takes an optional list argument for strings or a number range to accept,
It will loop with an appropriate error message until the user inputs a valid response.
The function will then return either the index of the word entered in the list (as int), or a number in range as a float.
